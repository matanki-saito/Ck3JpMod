 dungeon_ongoing.0001.t:0 "Incessant Chatter"
 dungeon_ongoing.0001.desc:0 "I cannot see who it is, or exactly where they are, but the only time their loud whispers are not echoing through the dank dungeon is when they are screaming instead."
 dungeon_ongoing.0001.a:0 "If it would stop for even a moment!"
 dungeon_ongoing.0001.b:0 ""Is it me you're talking to, friend?""

 dungeon_ongoing.0002.t:0 "The Wait"
 dungeon_ongoing.0002.desc:0 "It is the passing of time that really gets to me. Who knows how much time has passed, or how much time there is left of my stay? It could be hours or months."
 dungeon_ongoing.0002.a:0 "I need to get out of here!"
 dungeon_ongoing.0002.b:0 "I can wait as long as I need to."

 dungeon_ongoing.0003.t:0 ""Keep It Down!""
 dungeon_ongoing.0003.desc:0 "I have been haranguing the guards through the bars, telling them that they need to let me out. The only response I get is menacing looks and raised fists telling me to keep quiet."
 dungeon_ongoing.0003.a:0 "Appeals to duty is clearly not the way out."
 dungeon_ongoing.0003.b:0 "You think you can shut me up with threats?!"

 dungeon_ongoing.0004.t:0 "Infection"
 dungeon_ongoing.0004.desc:0 "I thought the wound was almost healed, but now it has started burning. I cannot look at it properly in the dark, but it feels bulbous to the touch.\n\nI cannot tell if the moistness accompanying the searing pain is blood, pus, or condensation from the dank air."
 dungeon_ongoing.0004.a:0 "Please, I need help..."
 dungeon_no_response_tooltip:0 "#F No one seems to hear your pleas.#!"

 dungeon_ongoing.0005.t:0 "The Fire Ends"
 dungeon_ongoing.0005.desc:0 "The skin around my wound feels hard, like wet wood, but the burning sensation has passed. It seems the infection is gone."

 dungeon_ongoing.0006.t:0 "Doom and Gloom"
 dungeon_ongoing.0006.desc:0 "A constant chill, perpetual dampness, and everlasting hunger from too thin gruel."
 dungeon_ongoing.0006.a:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], how could I ever deserve this?!"
 dungeon_ongoing.0006.b:0 "Eh, could have been worse."

 dungeon_ongoing.0007.t:0 "Yearning for Something More"
 dungeon_ongoing.0007.desc:0 "Stuck down here in the darkness while the world outside moves on. I should be out there, reaching for the heavens, not buried underground."
 dungeon_ongoing.0007.a:0 "I am worthy of so much more than this!"
 dungeon_ongoing.0007.b:0 "I have to focus on survival, and survival alone."

 dungeon_ongoing.0008.t:0 "The Passing of Days"
 dungeon_ongoing.0008.desc:0 "I have been down here forever. Has it been months? Years? Decades? My exile to the darkness never ends!"
 dungeon_ongoing.0008.a:0 "It's been sooo long!"

 dungeon_ongoing.0009.t:0 "The Comfort of a Friend"
 dungeon_ongoing.0009.desc:0 "I do not know how I would have survived down here without the comfort that my dear [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')] provides.\n\nWhenever I feel sad it is there to comfort me, whenever I feel like giving up it urges me on. I have never met another [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')] like it!"
 dungeon_ongoing.0009.a:0 "You are a lovely little [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')], aren't you?"

 dungeon_ongoing.9001.t:0 "Inside"
 dungeon_ongoing.9001.desc:0 "I do not recall the last time I saw the sun. I do not recall the last time I had solid food, or solid anything else. It feels like the dampness in the air has fastened itself in my lungs. If a tooth hurts, I simply pull it out of my rotting gums."
 dungeon_ongoing.9001.a:0 "It is so hard to move."

 dungeon_ongoing.9002.t:0 "Hollow"
 dungeon_ongoing.9002.desc:0 "The coughing never ends. It has been days, and I have not had an hour's sleep without waking with my hands clawing at my throat. Licking trickles of water off the wall does nothing anymore."
 dungeon_ongoing.9002.a:0 "I only want it to end."

 dungeon_ongoing.9003.t:0 "Recollection"
 dungeon_ongoing.9003.desc:0 "Will I ever be let out of here? Am I simply locked up, abandoned and forgotten? Does anyone but the gaoler know I am here? Is there anyone left who knows my name? Who knows who I was?"
 dungeon_ongoing.9003.a:0 "I can barely recall their faces..."

 dungeon_ongoing.9004.t:0 "Abandonment"
 dungeon_ongoing.9004.desc:0 "I will die here. I know it for certain. I will never again feel the sun on my face, or hear laughter not tinged with an edge of hopelessness."
 dungeon_ongoing.9004.a:0 "This is my whole world."

 dungeon_ongoing.9005.t:0 "Unfathomable Loss"
 dungeon_ongoing.9005.desc:0 "My faithful companion, my most treasured friend, my lifeline in this dark place...\n\nAs I cradle my dying [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')] in my arms I am overcome with the hopelessness of my situation. If a pure being such as it must die in this place, what chance do I stand?"
 dungeon_ongoing.9005.a:0 "You cannot leave me here alone!"
