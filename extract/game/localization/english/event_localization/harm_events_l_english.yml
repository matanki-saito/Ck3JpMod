Almost wretching, I try to haul myself out of bed, but my grip on the frame is frail, weak like a newborn babe.\n\nWith an almighty effort I judder to my feet and stagger over to the wash basin. By [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName], where did this weakness come from? I... I feel so sickly.\n\nThe cool water does little to refresh me. Bleary-eyed, I stare at the grim, hazy reflection in my polished silver mirror. The [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan] glaring back at me looks so very, very old."

My head stills spins from the blows and adrenaline, the surges of fear and rage and exultation and...\n\nSp-spinning. My head is spinning. My vision blurs, then doubles, and I begin to topple into the [ROOT.Char.Custom('GritType')].\n\n"Fetch a [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetRandomBattlefieldMedic')|U], the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] has been struck!", goes the cry,"
