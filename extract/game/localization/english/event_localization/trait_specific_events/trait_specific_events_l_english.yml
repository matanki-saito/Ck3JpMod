 trait_specific.1001.desc:0 "Strange people have been appearing around court lately – some I only see as shadows in the corner of my eye, and others I glimpse quickly and then they seem to be gone.\n\nNo matter how many guards I set on the task these strange people cannot be found, but the intensity of their taunting is only increasing!"
 trait_specific.1001.a:0 "There–! I could have sworn..."

 trait_specific.1002.desc:0 "Lately I have had a hard time thinking straight – my thoughts are scattered like clouds upon a summer sky.\n\nThe birds outside my window have started singing another tune. Other people seem to willfully talk in riddles, and no one acknowledges that cilantro is a truly horrid spice."
 trait_specific.1002.a:0 "Wait, what was I thinking about?"

 trait_specific.1010.t:0 "Emerging Lunacy"
 trait_specific.1010.desc:0 "This last week I have been spiraling, like a leaf in a tornado, going round round round. What is reality? What is #EMP real#!? I can no longer answer this.\n\nAll I know is that the woman in the clouds understands me, but the shadows are reaching further every day."
 trait_specific.1010.a:0 "Grasping like rodents... Shoo, away with you!"

 trait_specific.2001.t:0 "The Onset"
 trait_specific.2001.desc:0 "A sick feeling is rising in my stomach. I try to make it back to my chambers, but the door shrinks before my very eyes! What– what is happening?!\n\nSuddenly I can smell something... something I know I have smelled before, but... #EMP where#!? A servant asks me if I'm alright, but I cannot answer her, I cannot do anything..."
 trait_specific.2001.a:0 "I... How long was I gone?"

 trait_specific.2002.desc:0 "Lately I have experienced some... episodes. Something comes over me, taking charge of my body, and leaves me tired and confused.\n\nI have tried to keep it from people, tried to hide it, but it is hard to control something that comes and goes as it pleases."
 trait_specific.2002.a:0 "They are looking at me as if I am possessed..."

 trait_specific.3001.desc:0 "As a stray arrow whiz past my head in the yard I feel nothing – no fear, no anger, no panic.\n\nThis has been par for the course recently – I feel as if I exist behind a curtain, keeping me from feelings and the world. And I am so tired..."
 trait_specific.3001.a:0 "I think I will go back to bed."

 trait_specific.3002.desc_opening:0 "What is the meaning of it all? Why do we go through these motions day after day after day..."

 trait_specific.3999.desc:0 "My whole life I have felt that happiness did not come as easily to me as to others, and now the feeling is as foreign to me as air is to a fish."
 trait_specific.3999.desc_end:0 "\n\nMotivation and energy escapes me. As my life sinks into gray dullness I feel like I should be panicking, but even that is beyond me now."
 trait_specific.3999.a:0 "It is all too much..."

 trait_specific.4001.t:0 "Alternative Reading"
 trait_specific.4001.desc:0 "In a dusty corner of the library I find a tome – bound in leather and inscribed with weird symbols – partially hidden behind other books. It is old, but has obviously seen some recent use.\n\nAs I leaf through it I quickly come to the realization that it deals with some... unconventional knowledge."
 trait_specific.4001.a:0 "Interesting... I glance around before sitting down to read."
 trait_specific.4001.a_tt:0 "Hope the one who has been recently reading the book isn't around to see me..."
 trait_specific.4001.b:0 "Heresy! I'll turn it in to the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PriestNeuterPlural]."

 trait_specific.5001.t:0 "Gourmand"
 trait_specific.5001.desc:0 "Venison, elk, quail... There are so many exotic things to try in this world!\n\nAs plate after plate of exquisite meat is placed before me I cannot help but wonder what more is out there? What more flavorful adventures can I go on?"
 trait_specific.5001.a:0 "I must try it all!"
 trait_specific.5001.a.tt:0 "I will look for more exotic kinds of meat"
 trait_specific.5001.b:0 "The variation I have right here is fine."

 trait_specific.5002.desc:0 "On my quest for rare meats a thought has taken root in my mind. I can scarcely admit it even to myself, but I cannot help but wonder what human flesh would taste like...\n\nAs a servant at court sickens, and stand on death's doorstep, I order him placed in my private care."
 trait_specific.5002.a:0 "Forgive me – I must find out!"

 trait_specific.5003.desc:0 "It was only meant to be a short outing, a pleasant tour of the country-side. Now it has been days since we saw another living person, and our supplies are long since gone – we have already eaten the horses.\n\nOur guide promises that we will reach civilization within the week, but some of the servants are already at their limit, and my stomach growls louder for every hour that passes."
 trait_specific.5003.a:0 "We do what we have to to survive..."
 trait_specific.5003.b:0 "We can weather this!"

 trait_specific.6001.t:0 "Alternative Taste"
 trait_specific.6001.desc:0 "Lately regular activities have not... #EMP done#! it for me. Physicians have recommended various ointments, but nothing excites.\n\nAs I grow more and more desperate I stumble upon some books, hidden in the bottom of a pile in a merchants stall, that depict some... unusual activities. I find that I cannot stop turning the pages, and heat is stirring in my loins."
 trait_specific.6001.a:0 "Well, if this is what it takes..."

 trait_specific.6002.a:0 "Well, don't leave me waiting!"
 trait_specific.6002.b:0 "You are into things like this?!"
 trait_specific.6002.b_known:0 "I knew [lover.GetSheHe] was into some weird things, but this?!"

 trait_specific.7001.t:0 "Bottoms Up!"
 trait_specific.7001.desc:0 "Nothing calms me quite as efficiently as a full glass of [ROOT.Char.Custom('RegionalAlcoholicDrink')]. After a hard day, after a good day, after #EMP any#! day... I have found solace in the bottom of the cup."
 trait_specific.7001.a:0 "Bring me another!"
 trait_specific.7002.b:0 "I am stronger than this."

 trait_specific.8001.t:0 "Sprouting Interest"
 trait_specific.8001.desc:0 "A merchant has sent me samples of seeds – plants [ROOT.Char.Custom('RandomSheHe')] claims are good for health and mind.\n\nI must admit I have little experience in nurturing plants, but how hard could it be?"
 trait_specific.8001.a:0 "I will use these to start a private garden!"
 trait_specific.8001.a.success:0 "You grow a lush garden"
 trait_specific.8001.a.small_success:0 "The project fails, but you learn a lot"

 trait_specific.9001.a:0 "A fine verse! What shall I muse on next?"
 trait_specific.9001.b:0 "Writing is fun, but I don't know about #EMP rhyming#!."
 trait_specific.9001.c:0 "Perhaps I'll have a bath poured instead..."

 trait_specific.8501.desc:0 "I am speaking to several of my courtiers on a rather serious topic, when I can't help but notice [mean_courtier.GetTitledFirstName] snickering.\n\nIt is only when I confront [mean_courtier.GetHerHim] and [mean_courtier.GetSheHe] asks me to repeat the word 'suspicious' that I realise [mean_courtier.GetSheHe] is mocking my lisp."
 trait_specific.8501.a:0 "Rude but what can I do?"
 trait_specific.8501.b:0 "Imprison [mean_courtier.GetHerHim]!"
