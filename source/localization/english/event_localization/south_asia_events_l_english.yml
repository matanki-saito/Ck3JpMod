 south_asia.0030.desc:0 "Though we are one of the last bastions of Theravada teachings, our nobles continue to embrace the faith enthusiastically. The common folk, however, retain fierce pride in their traditional ways, and worship of their malevolent Nat deities remains widespread.\n\nA prudent ruler might find it wise to compromise when dealing with matters such as these, but perhaps a sterner approach is necessary..."

The common folk are angry, and there's no shortage of derisive mutters at the mention of your name amongst the more traditional types at court, [ari_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] among them.\n\nMy hand could yet be open as a peacemaker, or curled as the fist of an unforgiving ruler. Or, further still, I could withdraw it entirely and let the flame burn itself out in time. I must choose wisely..."

 south_asia.0032.desc:0 "The traditional Burmese folk deities still remain entrenched, particularly in the rural areas. Removing the peoples' right to worship as they wish would do more harm than good, and so the introduction of a thirty-seventh deity — Thagyamin, the Buddhist protector God — into the pantheon as the first and foremost of them was received wholly amicably.\n\nA golden opportunity now stands before you. The traditional heartlands of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] Buddhism lie in Lanka, but it is constantly threatened by powers on the mainland. Alternatively, it could be time for us to decide the path of our newly-strengthened faith."

 south_asia.0033.desc:0 "The religious insurrectionists are gone. Those brave and foolish enough to resist were cut down, but the majority kept their mouths shut and heads down for fear of persecution. The [ari_vassal.GetFaith.GetAdjective] religious leaders fled to the countryside where they could continue to practice their animistic rituals. \n\nThe question now turns to those at court who were once so brazen with their support, and yet now find their tongues so very still."

 south_asia.0035.desc:0 "Any true follower of the Buddha's notions can appreciate the sacred importance of preserving his words. The Pāli Canon, despite being written hundreds of years after Siddhārtha Gautama's death, represents the most accurate collection of the Buddha's words in the known world.\n\nWith the political machinations on the Indian mainland, there is a growing threat to the safety of such hallowed texts in the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] homelands on the peninsula of Lanka.

 south_asia.0036.t:0 "Dealing with the Ari"
 south_asia.0036.desc:0 "With the faith's future outside of the Irrawaddy Valley now secure, the one remaining question is what to do with the remaining [ari_faith.GetName] monks who still wield so much power, yet flaunt their hedonism at every turn. Their influence could be undermined, yet cannot be underestimated.\n\nThese wine-drinking, animal sacrificing religious leaders must be dealt with, but dealt with delicately lest their persecution is seen as a threat to the still-vulnerable peace in the region."
 south_asia.0036.a:0 "The people need to know of their sins. Divide and conquer."

 south_asia.0037.t:0 "The Faith Secured"
 south_asia.0037.desc:0 "As the last vestiges of the monks' power melts away, it is as though a millstone has been lifted off my shoulders. The religious relations in the kingdom are harmonious, the faith is thriving, and the people rightly look to me as their leader both politically and spiritually.\n\nMy great journey is at an end, and my realm can rightly call itself a true bastion of a strong and healthy [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName] faith."

 south_asia.0038.desc:0 "For many years now, the faithful across the Irrawaddy Valley have been struggling with a true religious divide. The city-dwelling nobles and their ilk are adherents of [proselytiser.GetFaith.GetName], whereas the common folk and those who live in the sprawling forests of the valley continue to worship the varied deities and spirits of the Ari faith.\n\nMe liege [proselytiser.GetFullName] has taken it upon [proselytiser.GetHerHim]self to heal this divide and establish the Theravada faith as the dominant one in [proselytiser.GetHerHis] lands and, by extension, mine too. Even now, [proselytiser.GetHerHis] monks sweep across my lands, refashioning the religious landscape in their preferred image."
 south_asia.0038.a:0 "The Theravada faith shall thrive!"

 south_asia.0039.desc:0 "The evangelizing work of [proselytiser.GetFullName] appears to have gone poorly. [proselytiser.GetHerHis|U] heavy-handed approach to spreading the Theravada faith has resulted in uproar and protests, which have subsequently been brutally crushed.\n\nAny lord or lady who dared protect an adherent of the embattled Ari faith has either vanished or now insists that they were misquoted, and none dare challenge the patience of their zealous liege.\n\nWhether there are further ramifications for those who were known to be on the side of the oppressed remains to be seen..."
 south_asia.0039.a:0 "It is no more than they deserve."
 south_asia.0039.b:0 "One day, the fallen faithful will be avenged."

As [proselytiser.GetHerHis] machinations progress, it has been impossible to stop the flood of preachers and Bhāṇakas venturing through my lands to spread their faith, and that of their [proselytiser.GetLordLady]'s.\n\nEven as Theravada takes hold, the traditional Ari adherents melt away into forest strongholds around the Arakan mountains, dwindling in numbers and shying away from open worship."
 south_asia.0040.a:0 "Wonderful! The true faith shall flourish!"
 south_asia.0040.b:0 "These actions will not go unremembered."

 south_asia.0041.desc:0 "It is the fifth monk of the day passing through my court that arouses my interest; it's rare for members of the faith to be so common out in the open. A quick questioning reveals the reason for this new deluge of the faithful across my lands.\n\n[proselytiser.GetFullName], a foreign [proselytiser.GetLadyLord], has been establishing the [proselytiser.GetFaith.GetName] faith across [proselytiser.GetHerHis] realm, and word has reached them about the trials and tribulations our shared faith has undergone in my realm over past generations as well.\n\nIn response, [proselytiser.GerSheHe] has sent many bhikku to help spread and support the faith in its ancestral homelands."
