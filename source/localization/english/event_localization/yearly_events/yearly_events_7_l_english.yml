 yearly.7001.desc:0 "My [marshal.GetCouncilTitle], [marshal.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], hands me my favorite [ROOT.Char.Custom('signature_weapon')]. It is sharpened and polished, so I see a fraction of my own visage within it.\n\n\"You should carry this for your own sake. Dissenters scurry through your court like diseased rats, and each time we attend a public function, I wonder if it is our last.\"\n\n[marshal.GetSheHe|U] stares out of the window. \"Perhaps we ought to increase the guard patrols... There is a sickly taste to this morning's air, and I am afraid.\""
 yearly.7001.a:0 "It will unnerve the guests! This is mere paranoia."
 yearly.7001.b:0 "Add a few more patrols in for luck."
 yearly.7001.c:0 "Do you #EMP know#! something, [marshal.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]?"

 yearly.7002:0 "You are in immediate peril, my [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetLadyLord|U]"
 yearly.7002.d:0 "I feel nothing but shame as I scribe these words. [coup_leader.GetTitledFirstName] has spent months bribing your guards. [coup_leader.GetSheHe|U] plans to stage an attack on your life in front the court... I wish for your life to be spared, but try as I may, I cannot stop my heart from bleeding for the cause of the [coup_faction.GetName].\n\nI have dashed into exile. We shall not meet again."
 yearly.7002.a:0 "I can trust no one!"
 yearly.7002.b:0 "I must trust some of my closest [ROOT.Char.Custom('KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase')] to guard me!"
 yearly.7002.b.tt:0 "[knight_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [knight_2.GetTitledFirstName] are some of my finest warriors. I must hope they will protect me."

 yearly.7004.desc:0 "\"Hurry! [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetSheHe|U] is waking up!\"\n\nAs I awaken, my pillow feels coarser than usual. My head is spinning, but the rest of my body goes with it and everything remains dark. I am not in my bed, but being dragged along the ground in a sack.\n\n\"[ROOT.GetCharacter.GetSheHe|U] is squirming too much! I keep losing my grip.\"\n\nAs the voices bicker, I quite easily struggle enough for them to drop the bag. When I crawl free, I realize they've barely gotten a few paces beyond the [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] garden."

 yearly.7004.a:0 "You call this a kidnapping? I'd at least expect you to get to [neighbor_county.GetNameNoTier]."
 yearly.7004.b:0 "Traitors! You shall both languish in sacks in my dungeon!"
 yearly.7004.c:0 "Carry me back to my bed at once!"
 yearly.7004.c.tt:0 "You are returned to the sack and ferried to your chamber"
 yearly.7005.preparation:0 "It is almost thrilling, sitting and waiting for the [coup_faction.GetName] to strike."
 yearly.7005.preparation_poor:1 "I have decided to trust no companion but my [ROOT.Char.Custom('SignatureWeaponNameOrType')], and we shall go to [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetAfterLifeDestination')] together, if we must."
 yearly.7005.preparation_good:0 "It is farcical that they think mere assassins could slay me."

 yearly.7005.ruler_death:1 "Their blood soon mingles with my own as I feel the [coup_leader.Custom('SignatureWeaponNameOrType')] strike my chest."
 yearly.7005.success:1 "It is foolish to think [coup_leader.GetSheHe] could take my throne in this tiny coup, but as [coup_leader.GetSheHe] turns a blade to [coup_leader.GetHerHis] own throat, I realize this was never what [coup_leader.GetSheHe] wanted."
 yearly.7005.a:0 "Guards, restrain [coup_leader.GetHerHim], [coup_leader.GetSheHe] cannot become a martyr for dissidents."
