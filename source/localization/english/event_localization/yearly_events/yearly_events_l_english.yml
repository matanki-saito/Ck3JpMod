With a little bit of love and care to this old facade, it could easily become a delightful little inn.\n\nI cannot imagine quite why this place has become so dilapidated. Its position is close to several villages, the doorway looks welcoming. It seems, for all the world, like it should be earning ample coin.\n\nWith the right land[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]."

 yearly.0029.edibles_average.1: "The patrons seems to have enjoyed most of the food, despite warding off a couple of brave rats.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_average.2: "Some guests questioned the beer they were served, frowning after taking a sniff, before pouring it into their mouths regardless.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_average.3: "Even if neither the food nor beer was by any means fantastic, the punters seem to have been in high spirits. Many literally.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_good.1: "The innkeeper had a difficult time keeping up with the demand, as the patrons barely sat down before ordering another round.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_good.2: "All the cheering has damned-near turned me deaf, so long and loud did it go on.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_good.3: "Not a single plate that was served came back with even as much as a crumb.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_bard_bad: "When the bard took center stage, [entertainer.GetSheHe] seemed... nervous, as though [entertainer.GetSheHe]'d never played to a crowd prior. Eyes afright as though [entertainer.GetSheHe]'d taken to the battlefield, [entertainer.GetSheHe] let out a single, piercing shriek — and fled.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_bard_average: "The bard entered the stage with a somewhat confident strut, pulling up a stool from the ground and smashing it down with one of [entertainer.GetHerHis] heavy boots on top of it. As soon as [entertainer.GetSheHe]’d brought forward [entertainer.GetHerHis] lute, the prior confidence in [entertainer.GetHerHis] posture faded. The crowd was greeted with a warbling, screechy ballad that not even a dying, deaf grandparent would have appreciated.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_bard_good: "Early on, a faint melody could be heard from the gloom outside, slowly grabbing the attention of every drunk. A hush settled over the crowd, and all eyes became fixed on the way in. The song became louder, louder still, till the door flew open and a handsome bard entered. [entertainer.GetHerHis|U] refrain rose to a crescendo, then crashed down into a jaunty tune and a chorus of raucous cheers — the first of many to come.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_poet_bad: "The poet entered the stage with a scrap of parchment in [entertainer.GetHerHis] hands, doing [entertainer.GetHerHis] utmost to get the attention of the crowd before starting, to little avail. [entertainer.GetSheHe] took a closer look at [entertainer.GetHerHis] notes, tried to squeak out a few lines directly — only to be drowned out by a chorus of boos, and flee weeping into the night.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_poet_average: "The poet's radiant aura drew eyes as soon as [entertainer.GetSheHe] entered, making even the dullest patron look up from their mugs at all the fuss. As soon as the poet started to recite, the spell broke: with nothing but a dirge to entice them, the clueless crowd quickly lost interest and returned to their ale.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_poet_good: "The poet dramatically strode onto the stage, reciting [entertainer.GetHerHis] lines with such fiery passion that not a heart present was left unstirred. [entertainer.GetHerHis|U] words rang so heavily against us, all prior emotions seemed... weightless, by comparison. Not a single soul left the establishment that day without a tear in their eye — be it of joy or sadness.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_jester_bad: "I’d been fooled by the fool for believing that [entertainer.GetSheHe]’d turn up for the evening, while in fact no trace could lead back to [entertainer.GetHerHim]. The anticipation for the night’s entertainment quickly turned sour, with the ornery crowd grumbling in disbelief at my miserly excuses.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_jester_average: "The jester managed to make the atmosphere a bit lighter within the inn, but at the cost of some occasional awkward silences and jokes that went over the heads of simple-minded — and simply inebriated — peasants.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_jester_good: "The jester swept onto the stage with a yell and a cartwheel. The entire inn erupted in cries and applause as [entertainer.GetSheHe] did twirl gracefully through the air, jumping across tables, stools, and patrons alike. Every other feat was combined with a witty quip (even whilst gasping for air), leaving the poor fool exhausted by the night's end. It turned out to be a rather breathtaking evening for everybody involved.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.conclusion_outro: "My work here is done."
 yearly.0029.a: "What a night!"
