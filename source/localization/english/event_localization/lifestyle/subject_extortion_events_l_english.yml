 subject_extortion.0001.desc:0 "My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('extortion_target'))], [extortion_target.GetTitledFirstName] — now there is a [extortion_target.GetWomanMan] of means. Judging by [extortion.GetHerHis] expression, [extortion_target.GetSheHe] already knows for what purpose I am approaching [extortion_target.GetHerHim].\n\n\"I am loyal, I pay my dues,\" [extortion_target.GetSheHe] insists. \"How can you ask more of me?\""
 subject_extortion.0001.a:0 "Consider it an extra little test of loyalty!"
 subject_extortion.0001.b:0 "Do not worry, I will have #EMP everyone#! pay."
 subject_extortion.0001.c:0 "ああ、でもまだ私に借りがあるんだよね？"
 subject_extortion.0001.d:0 "I am merely joking, [extortion_target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 subject_extortion.0001.d.flavor:0 "[extortion_target.GetSheHe|U] seems more upset than I expected."

 subject_extortion.0002.desc:0 "The peasants of the [extortion_target.GetName] seem to be doing better than one might expect from the taxes I have collected there. An extra contribution to my treasury should do no harm.\n\nOh, they will complain, but is that not what peasants always do? They will live through this, I am sure of it."
 subject_extortion.0002.a:0 "They can do whatever they please, as long as I get my gold!"
 subject_extortion.0002.b:0 "Why are they never grateful for what they #EMP do#! have?"
 subject_extortion.0002.c:0 "It is not worth upsetting them right now."
 subject_extortion.0003.t:0 "臣下からの強制徴発: [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.AltPriestTermPlural|U]"
 subject_extortion.0003.desc:0 "Would [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WealthGodName] not want me to prosper? And would not a well-stocked treasury be the best means for that?\n\nFor some reason, the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.AltPriestTermPlural] is reluctant to agree. They seem to think that the sway they hold over their congregations will protect them."
 subject_extortion.0003.a:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PriestNeuterPlural|U] must contribute as much as anyone else!"
 subject_extortion.0003.b:0 "Have I not earned this, by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]?"
 subject_extortion.0003.c:0 "It is a bad idea to upset servants of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]..."
 subject_extortion.0004.t:0 "臣下からの強制徴発: 封臣"
 subject_extortion.0004.desc:0 "封臣たちの目的はまさに私の努力を支援することだ。彼らはすでに特権のために税金を払っているが、私は彼らがもう少しだけ金を出したとしたら、どれだけ多くのものを得るかを考えずにはいられない...\n\n彼らには大きな負担がなく、私に莫大な富が集まる！"
 subject_extortion.0004.a:0 "なんて完璧な解決法だ！"
 subject_extortion.0004.b:0 "#EMP たくさん#!取れるというのになぜ少ししかとらないのか？"

 subject_extortion.0005.desc:0 "私の廷臣たちは私の寛大さに実質的に頼って生活している。彼らは感謝の気持ちを表すべき時ではないだろうか。\n\n下級貴族でも、名誉や義務について理解しなければならない。"
 subject_extortion.0005.a:0 "彼らは#EMP 生きる#!ことさえ我が慈悲にのみすがるのだ！"
 subject_extortion.0005.b:0 "要求しているのではない、だが、期待はしている。"
 subject_extortion.0005.c:0 "Oh, they already have so little in this world..."

 subject_extortion.9998.desc:0 "Despite my grace and honorable character, I seem unable to find anyone who is willing to support me more than my law obliges them to. None of them seem excited about supporting my ideas for new laws, either.\n\nAm I forced to suffer destitution at the hands of my greedy and selfish servants?!"
 subject_extortion.9998.a:0 "Hold on! What is that clinking in your pocket?"
 subject_extortion.9998.b:0 "Wait, what is this under my seat?"
