 historical_commander_trait.0001.desc:0 "古代の将軍の戦術を研究していた時、私は[ROOT.Char.Custom('surprised_reaction')]で、第二次Punic戦争中のハンニバル・バカルの功績を知りました。\n\n#F 「ローマの敵」として知られるハンニバルの最高傑作はカンネの戦いで、約5万人の彼の軍隊が8万6千人の強大なローマ軍を出し抜き、包囲したことだった。囲まれて退却することができず、たった3,000人のローマ人だけが大虐殺を生き延びた。#!"

 historical_commander_trait.0002.t:0 "Caesar's Triumph"
 historical_commander_trait.0002.desc:0 "While studying the tactics of ancient generals I was amused to learn about Julius Caesar's exploits during his conquest of Gaul.\n\n#F During his siege of Alesia, Caesar determined that direct assault on the well-fortified city would be too costly. He instead ordered his army build his own fortress which surrounded the entire city, trapping the enemy garrison inside to starve while simultaneously preventing reinforcements from relieving the defenders.#!"
 historical_commander_trait.0002.a:0 "A little ingenuity goes a long way in a siege."
 historical_commander_trait.0002.b:0 "Make the enemy come to you! I like it!"

 historical_commander_trait.0003.desc:0 "While studying the tactics of ancient generals I was [ROOT.Char.Custom('surprised_reaction')] to learn about the exploits of Alexander the Great during his conquest of Mesopotamia.\n\n#F During the Siege of Tyre, Alexander assaulted an island fortress by demolishing a nearby town and then using the rubble to build a causeway stretching from the mainland to the city's walls. This allowed his siege engines to attack the enemy fortress directly, though it was his navy which ultimately created a breach.#!"
 historical_commander_trait.0003.a:0 "No amount of water will stop my armies!"
 historical_commander_trait.0003.b:0 "That causeway was a feat of great ingenuity."
 historical_commander_trait.0003.c:0 "Turning my foe's resources against them? Brilliant!"
 historical_commander_trait.0003.d:0 "Why waste time studying tactics which didn't work?"
 historical_commander_trait.0004.t:0 "The Vision of Chi-Rho"
 historical_commander_trait.0004.desc:0 "While studying the tactics of ancient generals I was inspired when I learned about Constantine's victory at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge.\n\n#F The night before the battle, Constantine dreamed that victory would be granted if he painted Chi-Rho, a symbol of Christ, on his soldier's shields. He did exactly that, and the next day he overran the forces of the usurper Maxentius, who fell into the Tiber River and drowned.#!"
 historical_commander_trait.0004.a:0 "The wicked are no match for God's armies!"
 historical_commander_trait.0004.b:0 "Like Constantine, no river can delay my victory!"

 historical_commander_trait.0005.desc:0 "While studying the tactics of historical generals I became contemplative upon learning about Khalid ibn al-Walid's first battle after his conversion to Islam.\n\n#F Outnumbered more than 3 to 1 by the Byzantines during the Battle of Mu'tah, Khalid rallied his wavering soldiers to hold the line. This defiant stand allowed him to organize a retreat to Medina, saving his men from certain death. Khalid and his army later went on to conquer all of Arabia in Allah's name!#!"
