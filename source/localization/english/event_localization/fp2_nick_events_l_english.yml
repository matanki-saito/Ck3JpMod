 fp2_yearly.4001.desc:0 "My goodness! Being a ruler really does take it out of you. I have to toil all day and much of the night too in order to maintain my lands. The peasants lead blessed lives in that respect; they don't have the pressures of rulership to weigh them down and cause them so much lethargy!\n\nPerhaps a little nap would do me good? I can sleep off the exertions of lunch and be ready to tackle the rest of the day!"
 fp2_yearly.4001.a:0 "No! I have work to do!"
 fp2_yearly.4001.b:0 "Mm, #EMP lovely.#!"

 fp2_yearly.4002.desc:0 "The disapproving frown on my [realm_priest.GetCouncilTitle] [realm_priest.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] face readies me pre-emptively for what is sure to be some manner of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]-bothering nonsense.\n\n\"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord],\" [realm_priest.GetSheHe] begins, \"there is a matter of grave import happening within your very realm. The county of [interfaith_province.GetCounty.GetName] is filled with people not following the true faith! If that wasn't bad enough, they're living alongside those who do! And, and, and #EMP fornicating#! with each other and-\"\n\nI close my eyes as the interminable drone continues. I dread to think how [realm_priest.GetSheHe] will carry on if I don't do something..."
 fp2_yearly.4002.a:0 "Let them live in peace, [realm_priest.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 fp2_yearly.4002.b:0 "You're right. This can't continue."

 fp2_yearly.4003.desc:0 "The holy city of Santiago de Compostela is a magnet for the faithful, drawing pilgrims from lands local and distant. The route to it is accordingly well-travelled, wending its way to the site from the foothills of the Pyrenees. Of course, where people rich enough to travel to the holy site exist, so too do those looking to profit from their trust in the almighty.\n\nIt is the fifth report of a violent robbery by bandits in as many days on the stretches of land that run through my territory that finally drives my [steward.GetCouncilTitle] [steward.GetFirstName] to consult with me on how to deal with this issue."
 fp2_yearly.4003.a:0 "I shall contact the holy warriors in [ho_province.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetName]!"
 fp2_yearly.4003.b:0 "Pay for guards to patrol a section of the road."
 fp2_yearly.4003.c:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] helps those who help themselves..."
 fp2_yearly.4003.tt:0 "The local [holy_order|E] will patrol the road in their county."
