 game_concept_struggle:1 "Struggle"
 game_concept_struggle_struggles:0 "闘争"
 game_concept_struggle_desc:2 "$game_concept_struggle_struggles$とは、長期間の戦乱のことで、広大な[struggle_region_regions|E]の、数多くの[faiths|E]や[cultures|E]を巻き込んで繰り広げられます。$game_concept_struggle$が行われる境界線の内側では、一風変わった独特なルールと[modifiers|E]が発動し、時間と共に変化していきます。また、数十年から数百年単位で続くため、$game_concept_struggle$に関与する[characters|E]の全員が、常時、互いに[war|E]中である、というわけではありません。\n\nどの$game_concept_struggle$にも、多段階の[struggle_phase_phases|E]が存在しています。[struggle_region|E]内の$game_concept_characters$による（例えば$game_concept_war$の宣言や[marrying|E]などの）行いは、[struggle_catalyst_catalysts|E]の働きを喚起し得ます。これは、異なる$game_concept_struggle_phase_phases$間の進行度を進めるものです。\n\n他の参加者から$game_concept_struggle$の一部と見られる度合いによって、その地域に[land|E]を持つ$game_concept_characters$は[struggle_involved|E]、[struggle_interloper_interlopers|E]、[struggle_uninvolved|E]として見られる場合があります。"
 game_concept_iberian_struggle:1 "イベリアの闘争"
 game_concept_iberian_struggle_desc:2 "The $game_concept_iberian_struggle$ depicts the centuries of fractious relationships on the Iberian Peninsula. Though born of the Umayyad  Conquest of Iberia in the 8th Century, the [struggle|E] shifts between [struggle_phase_phases|E] of hate-fueled violence, wary truces, and pragmatic cooperation. There are few permanent allies in such a situation, and [rulers|E] should be wary of relying purely on a shared [faith|E] or [culture|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_desc:1 "A $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$ is a general mood common to [struggle_involved|E] [characters|E] and [counties|E] within a [struggle_region|E]. It represents short-term societal trends and mores temporarily dominating the dialogue of the [struggle|E].\n\n#weak Example: in one $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$, the people of a $game_concept_struggle_region_region$ may think that religious tolerance is paramount even if the rest of their faith disagrees.#!"

A list of which actions are important in which $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$ can be found in the $game_concept_struggle$ window.\n\n#weak Example: the [struggle_phase_iberia_opportunity|E] of the [iberian_struggle|E] can transition into either the [struggle_phase_iberia_hostility|E] or the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E]. Murdering an important [character|E] might work towards the former, whilst forming a [marriage|E] [alliance|E] with someone of a different [faith|E] would build towards the latter."
 game_concept_struggle_involved:1 "Involved"
 game_concept_struggle_involved_desc:1 "[character|E]、[county|E]が$game_concept_struggle_involved$である、これが意味するのは、その[struggle_region|E]の人々が[character|E]や[county|E]を[struggle|E]における自然でかつ不可欠な地位にあるとみなしている、ということです。それらは[struggle_phase_phases|E]の流動的アドバンテージから十全に利益を受けます。そして、[struggle_catalyst_catalysts|E]の第一の点火役となります。\n\n$game_concept_struggle_involved$だとみなされる[cultures|E]および[faiths|E]は、$game_concept_struggle_region_region$で強大な存在感を有していたか、もしくは今もなお有しています。\n\n#weak $game_concept_struggle_involved$となるには、$game_concept_character$が$game_concept_struggle_involved$である$game_concept_culture$と$game_concept_faith$の両方を有し、#EMP かつ#! $game_concept_struggle_region$内で[unlanded|E]か、もしくは[capital|E] を有している、という状態でなければなりません。#!"

 game_concept_struggle_interloper_desc:1 "When a [character|E] is tangled up in a specific [struggle|E] but not yet considered fully [struggle_involved|E], they're an $game_concept_struggle_interloper$.\n\n$game_concept_struggle_interloper_interlopers$ have their [capital|E]s within the [struggle_region|E] (or they're [unlanded|E] there), but do not have both an $game_concept_struggle_involved$ [faith|E] and an $game_concept_struggle_involved$ [culture|E].\n\nFully $game_concept_struggle_involved$ $game_concept_characters$ think of them as nosy, troublesome outlanders who don't understand where they're not wanted. $game_concept_struggle_interloper$ [rulers|E] thus generally take some penalties in [counties|E] they hold inside a $game_concept_struggle_region$."
 game_concept_struggle_uninvolved:1 "Uninvolved"
 game_concept_struggle_uninvolved_desc:1 "For a [character|E] to be considered $game_concept_struggle_uninvolved$ in a particular [struggle|E], they need only have their [capital|E] outside the [struggle_region|E], or else be [unlanded|E] outside of it.\n\nThis means they're considered an outsider, someone who not only doesn't have a serious stake in the ongoing [struggle_phase_phases|E], but who #EMP shouldn't#!, because they clearly couldn't understand the local nuances.\n\nAs one of the only things people inside a $game_concept_struggle$ can agree on is that $game_concept_struggle_uninvolved$ $game_concept_characters$ have no business in #EMP their#! lands, $game_concept_struggle_uninvolved$ [rulers|E] generally take harsh penalties in any [counties|E] they hold within a $game_concept_struggle_region$."

 game_concept_struggle_conquest_conquests:0 "Clashes"
 game_concept_struggle_conquest_desc:2 "It's not uncommon for [rulers|E] involved in a [struggle|E] to get into border disputes and petty quarrels, changing with the nature of the current [struggle_phase|E]. The ready availability of niche local disputes allows $game_concept_rulers$ to conduct small-scale land grabs, conquering or vassalizing their targets.\n\nSince $game_concept_struggle_conquest_conquests$ depend on the environment of their $game_concept_struggle$, their [prestige|E] cost scales with the current $game_concept_struggle_phase$."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_opportunity_desc:2 "After a long period of relatively peaceful coexistence during the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E], complacency begins to set in. Peasantry and nobility alike are comfortable that things just #EMP work#!, allowing more shrewd [characters|E] to take advantage of their naivety.\n\nEventually, fresh abuses will either cause an escalation into the [struggle_phase_iberia_hostility|E], or else savvy politicking reaches an uneasy equilibrium through the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_compromise_desc:2 "Whether through sickness with the strife of the [struggle_phase_iberia_hostility|E] or deft escalation during the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E], the $game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_compromise$ represents a growing accommodation between the peoples of Iberia.

 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation:1 "Conciliation Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation_desc:1 "The product of a notable [struggle_phase_iberia_compromise|E], during this $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$, relations between the peoples of Iberia grow so cordial that outsiders find their permissiveness difficult to parse. Inter-[faith|E] [marriages|E] are particularly common.\n\nThis can't last forever, though, and abuses of trust will eventually bring the [iberian_struggle|E] back around to the [struggle_phase_iberia_compromise|E]."
